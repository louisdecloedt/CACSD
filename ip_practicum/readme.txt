Welcome,

Normally u will find this file together with following files:

-closed_loop_1.m
-closed_loop_1.m
-open_loop.m

Which are the files used to analyze the given inverted pendulum system.

-ip_real_time.slx
-sl_closed_loop_1.slx
-sl_closed_loop_2.slx

These files are the used Simulink diagrams, the realtime one is never
tested so it probably wont work, the other ones do.
Don't forget to run the respective .m file first.

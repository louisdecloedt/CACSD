Welcome,

Normally u will find this file together with following files:

-LQR_control.m
-LQR_integral_control.m
-LQG_control.m
-pole_placement.m

Which are the matlab files used to control the quadcopter as asked in sections 4.3 4.4 and 4.5. 
The payload can be changed in the Simulink diagram with corresponding name.


-LQR_control_quadcopter.slx
-LQR_integral_control_quadcopter.slx
-LQG_control_quadcopter.slx
-pole_placement_quadcopter.slx

These files are the used Simulink diagrams.

The following filenames allow the above files to reproduce our results:

-references_17.mat
-generate_report.p
-quadcopter_sfunction.p
-icon_quad.png
